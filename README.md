# Final Project
Final-term Project: Web Service
***

### Objective
This project aims to test the skills of the students in developing a web service that can process and evaluate toxic comments using their chosen programming language and frameworks.

### Specifications

* Pick up additional two members for your team (total of three persons/team).
* Develop a **Web Service** for masking toxic **Tagalog** & **English** comments.
* Your team should decide what programming language  will you use (Python, Java + Groovy, C#) to develop the said Web Service.
* The Web Service response can either be in **XML** or **JSON**.
* Adding a Responsive Web App that can utilize the Web Service is a plus. Please take note that this Web Service can also be used by Social Networking Sites and Massively Multiplayer Online Games for filtering out toxic messages from their users.
* **+10 bonus points** will be given to the team that can implement  **Hiligaynon** masking.
* **Be creative**.
